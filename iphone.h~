* @section intro Introduction
* This package provides code templates for use by GLAST developers. 
* All header files for external access are located in the templates directory,
* as it is customary to put external public header files in the packageName 
* directory. Header files that are not meant for external access reside in 
* the src directory. Source files are located in the src directory. Files 
* related to loading sharable libraries are located in the src/Dll directory.
* There are 3 examples:
* 
* - User-Defined generic C++ class
* -# templates/ClassTemplate.h
* -# src/ClassTemplate.cxx
* - User-Defined Gaudi Algorithm
* -# src/ExampleAlg.cxx
* -# src/Dll/templates_dll.cxx
* -# src/Dll/templates_load.cxx
* - User-Defined Gaudi Service
* -# templates/IExampleSvc.h
* -# templates/ExampleSvc.h
* -# src/ExampleSvc.cxx
* -# src/Dll/templates_dll.cxx
* -# src/Dll/templates_load.cxx
*
*
* Also note the existence of the following directories:
* - cmt
* -# Contains the requirements file
* - doc
* -# Contains the release.notes file
*
*
* As you prepare to develop code for GLAST SAS, please be sure you are aware 
* of our current
* <A HREF="http://www-glast.slac.stanford.edu/software/CodeHowTo/codeStandards.html"> Coding Standards </A>
*
*
* If using the code in this package as an example - please modify the comments
* as appropriate for your own specific code.
