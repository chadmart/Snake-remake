 <h2><a class="anchor" id="Overview"></a>
Purpose/Overview</h2>
<p>The program starts out by displaying intro screen 1 which asks the user for a number from 1 to 5 which correlates to the speed of the snake and the points multiplier. 1 is the slowest speed and 5 is the fastest speed. The faster the speed the bigger the points multiplier. </p>
<p>Next intro screen 2 is displayed, the user is asked if he/she would like to enable wrap around. If wrap around is enabled, the snake is allowed to go through the borders. If wrap around is disabled and the snake hits the borders, it will cause a game over. Also, If wrap around is disabled, the points multiplier is doubled. </p>
<p>After the game options are set, the game starts at 0 points with 2 pieces on the screen. One of the pieces is a <a class="el" href="classSnakeBlock.html" title="The SnakeBlock Represents one block of the Snake.">SnakeBlock</a> head. This piece is the snake that the user controls with the arrow keys. The other piece is a green Apple logo. This piece is a normal piece of food. When the snake collides with the normal piece of food, the snake will grow 1 block and the points will increase by 7 times the points multiplier. After the collision, the food will spawn in a new random location. Also in the window, there is an iPhone. This is the border around the screen. On the status bar of the iPhone, the points that the user has accumulated are displayed. If the snake head runs over another part of the snake, it will always cause a game over. If wrap around is disabled and the snake hits the border, it will cause a game over. </p>
<p>Another piece that can spawn is a Windows 8 logo. This piece is a special piece of food. When the snake collides with the special piece of food, the game will go into a blue screen of death. This piece will spawn every ten grows or if ‘W’ is pressed. </p>
<p>Another piece that can spawn is a Linux logo. This piece is the winning piece of food. When the snake collides with the winning piece of food, the game will end and a victory screen will appear. This piece will spawn after the special piece of food is painted in 100 paint events or if ‘L’ is pressed. </p>
<p>When a blue screen of death occurs, the game stops, the users points are set to zero, and a blue screen of death is displayed. After any key is pressed the game moves on to the game over screen. </p>
<p>When a game over occurs, the game stops and the game over screen is displayed. On the game over screen, the words game over, the total number of points, and instructions for the user to play again are displayed. If the user presses the Space bar, the game starts over and intro screen 1 is displayed. </p>
<p>When a victory occurs, the game stops and the victory screen is displayed. On the victory screen, the words victory, the total number of points, and instructions for the user to play again are displayed. If the user presses the Space bar, the game starts over and intro screen 1 is displayed. </p>
<p>If the user presses ESC at any time during the program, the program will quit.</p>

 <h2><a class="anchor" id="High-level_Architecture"></a>
High-level Architecture</h2>
<p>When the program starts, the QT window is initialized and the basic window settings are set such as the size of the window. Then <a class="el" href="classGame.html" title="The Snake Game Logic. This class contains the logic that makes up the Snake Game.">Game</a> is launched. Next, the required objects are created from the following classes: <a class="el" href="classSnake.html" title="The Snake Represents the infinitely growing snake which is made up of a vector of SnakeBlock pointers...">Snake</a>, <a class="el" href="classFood.html" title="A Food piece The parent of all food pieces. If not inherited, Food represents a red or green Apple Lo...">Food</a>, <a class="el" href="classSpecialFood.html" title="A SpecialFood piece A daughter of the Food class. Represents a Windows 8 Logo. If Snake collides with...">SpecialFood</a>, WinningFood, and iPhone. When an object of the <a class="el" href="classSnake.html" title="The Snake Represents the infinitely growing snake which is made up of a vector of SnakeBlock pointers...">Snake</a> class is created, a vector of <a class="el" href="classSnakeBlock.html" title="The SnakeBlock Represents one block of the Snake.">SnakeBlock</a> objects is created. After that, the paint event is called which displays intro screen 1. The user is asked to select the speed which will set the timer delay and the points multiplier. Once the user makes a selection, another paint event is called which displays intro screen 2. During intro screen 2, the user is asked to whether to enable or disable wrap around which will set wraparound to TRUE or FALSE. Once the user makes a selection, startGame is called which starts the timer, resets data members to default values, deletes <a class="el" href="classSnake.html" title="The Snake Represents the infinitely growing snake which is made up of a vector of SnakeBlock pointers...">Snake</a>, creates a new <a class="el" href="classSnake.html" title="The Snake Represents the infinitely growing snake which is made up of a vector of SnakeBlock pointers...">Snake</a> dynamically, and moves food using moveFood and checkBadFood methods of the <a class="el" href="classFood.html" title="A Food piece The parent of all food pieces. If not inherited, Food represents a red or green Apple Lo...">Food</a> class. Then, another paint event is called which displays the game play screen. </p>
<p>Now, the game begins. Once the user presses an arrow key, the snake begins to move by the autoMove method of the <a class="el" href="classSnake.html" title="The Snake Represents the infinitely growing snake which is made up of a vector of SnakeBlock pointers...">Snake</a> class and collision detection occurs after each time the snake moves by the checkCollision method of the game class. If during checkCollision the snake makes an illegal collision, then the gameOver function is called and the game either restarts or the program terminates. If during checkCollision the snake collides with an Apple logo, the snake grows 1 <a class="el" href="classSnakeBlock.html" title="The SnakeBlock Represents one block of the Snake.">SnakeBlock</a> using snake-&gt;grow and points are added to points. If during checkCollision the snake collides with a Windows 8 logo, the blueScreenDeath function is called which displays the bsod. If during checkCollision the snake collides with a Linux logo, the victory screen is displayed using the victory function. If the user presses ‘P’, pauseGame function is called and game is paused. </p>
<p>If the user presses ESC at any time, qApp-&gt;exit function is called and program is terminated. </p>
<p>If the user presses ‘R’ at any time, stopGame function is called, introPrompt1 is set to true, and intro screen 1 is displayed.</p>
