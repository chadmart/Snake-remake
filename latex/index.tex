\-The program starts out by displaying intro screen 1 which asks the user for a number from 1 to 5 which correlates to the speed of the snake and the points multiplier. 1 is the slowest speed and 5 is the fastest speed. \-The faster the speed the bigger the points multiplier. 

\-Next intro screen 2 is displayed, the user is asked if he/she would like to enable wrap around. \-If wrap around is enabled, the snake is allowed to go through the borders. \-If wrap around is disabled and the snake hits the borders, it will cause a game over. \-Also, \-If wrap around is disabled, the points multiplier is doubled. 

\-After the game options are set, the game starts at 0 points with 2 pieces on the screen. \-One of the pieces is a \hyperlink{classSnakeBlock}{\-Snake\-Block} head. \-This piece is the snake that the user controls with the arrow keys. \-The other piece is a green \-Apple logo. \-This piece is a normal piece of food. \-When the snake collides with the normal piece of food, the snake will grow 1 block and the points will increase by 7 times the points multiplier. \-After the collision, the food will spawn in a new random location. \-Also in the window, there is an i\-Phone. \-This is the border around the screen. \-On the status bar of the i\-Phone, the points that the user has accumulated are displayed. \-If the snake head runs over another part of the snake, it will always cause a game over. \-If wrap around is disabled and the snake hits the border, it will cause a game over. 

\-Another piece that can spawn is a \-Windows 8 logo. \-This piece is a special piece of food. \-When the snake collides with the special piece of food, the game will go into a blue screen of death. \-This piece will spawn every ten grows or if ‘\-W’ is pressed. 

\-Another piece that can spawn is a \-Linux logo. \-This piece is the winning piece of food. \-When the snake collides with the winning piece of food, the game will end and a victory screen will appear. \-This piece will spawn after the special piece of food is painted in 100 paint events or if ‘\-L’ is pressed. 

\-When a blue screen of death occurs, the game stops, the users points are set to zero, and a blue screen of death is displayed. \-After any key is pressed the game moves on to the game over screen. 

\-When a game over occurs, the game stops and the game over screen is displayed. \-On the game over screen, the words game over, the total number of points, and instructions for the user to play again are displayed. \-If the user presses the \-Space bar, the game starts over and intro screen 1 is displayed. 

\-When a victory occurs, the game stops and the victory screen is displayed. \-On the victory screen, the words victory, the total number of points, and instructions for the user to play again are displayed. \-If the user presses the \-Space bar, the game starts over and intro screen 1 is displayed. 

\-If the user presses \-E\-S\-C at any time during the program, the program will quit.

\-When the program starts, the \-Q\-T window is initialized and the basic window settings are set such as the size of the window. \-Then \hyperlink{classGame}{\-Game} is launched. \-Next, the required objects are created from the following classes\-: \hyperlink{classSnake}{\-Snake}, \hyperlink{classFood}{\-Food}, \hyperlink{classSpecialFood}{\-Special\-Food}, \-Winning\-Food, and i\-Phone. \-When an object of the \hyperlink{classSnake}{\-Snake} class is created, a vector of \hyperlink{classSnakeBlock}{\-Snake\-Block} objects is created. \-After that, the paint event is called which displays intro screen 1. \-The user is asked to select the speed which will set the timer delay and the points multiplier. \-Once the user makes a selection, another paint event is called which displays intro screen 2. \-During intro screen 2, the user is asked to whether to enable or disable wrap around which will set wraparound to \-T\-R\-U\-E or \-F\-A\-L\-S\-E. \-Once the user makes a selection, start\-Game is called which starts the timer, resets data members to default values, deletes \hyperlink{classSnake}{\-Snake}, creates a new \hyperlink{classSnake}{\-Snake} dynamically, and moves food using move\-Food and check\-Bad\-Food methods of the \hyperlink{classFood}{\-Food} class. \-Then, another paint event is called which displays the game play screen. 

\-Now, the game begins. \-Once the user presses an arrow key, the snake begins to move by the auto\-Move method of the \hyperlink{classSnake}{\-Snake} class and collision detection occurs after each time the snake moves by the check\-Collision method of the game class. \-If during check\-Collision the snake makes an illegal collision, then the game\-Over function is called and the game either restarts or the program terminates. \-If during check\-Collision the snake collides with an \-Apple logo, the snake grows 1 \hyperlink{classSnakeBlock}{\-Snake\-Block} using snake-\/$>$grow and points are added to points. \-If during check\-Collision the snake collides with a \-Windows 8 logo, the blue\-Screen\-Death function is called which displays the bsod. \-If during check\-Collision the snake collides with a \-Linux logo, the victory screen is displayed using the victory function. \-If the user presses ‘\-P’, pause\-Game function is called and game is paused. 

\-If the user presses \-E\-S\-C at any time, q\-App-\/$>$exit function is called and program is terminated. 

\-If the user presses ‘\-R’ at any time, stop\-Game function is called, intro\-Prompt1 is set to true, and intro screen 1 is displayed.
